## What Is the European Accessibility Act (EAA)?

### The EAA in a Nutshell

- The EAA mandates that many products and services must be accessible — and the law comes into effect in June 2025.
- The EAA also represents a massive opportunity for your business:
    - Unlocks access to a growing market that represents significant buying power (up to 1 trillion Euros annually).
    - Improves the usability of your products and services.
    - Strengthens your brand and relationship with customers.

### What Is the Goal of the EAA?

A harmonised approach to define, standardize, and enforce what it means to be accessible across the EU.
