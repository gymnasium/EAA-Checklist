# What Executives & Business Leaders Should Be Doing to Prepare for the EAA

## 1. Assess Current Compliance & Risk Exposure

- Conduct an Accessibility Audit
  - Evaluate websites, mobile apps, digital services, self-service terminals, e-commerce platforms, and customer interfaces against WCAG 2.1 AA standards and other EAA requirements.
  - Identify gaps in digital accessibility, customer communication, and physical product accessibility.

- Identify High-Risk Areas
  - Determine which parts of the business are most affected (e.g., banking interfaces, retail e-commerce, transportation ticketing, e-books, ATMs, mobile apps).
  - Prioritize updates to avoid rushed compliance efforts close to the deadline.

## 2. Establish Leadership Buy-In & Accountability

- Appoint an Accessibility Compliance Leader
  - Assign a senior leader or cross-functional task force responsible for EAA compliance.
  - Ensure executive sponsorship to secure funding and commitment across teams.

- Develop an Accessibility Roadmap
  - Create a phased implementation plan to address compliance over the next 12–16 months.
  - Allocate budget for accessibility improvements, training, and technology upgrades.

- Engage Legal & Compliance Teams
  - Work with legal advisors to understand country-specific enforcement policies and fines.
  - Ensure contracts with vendors and third-party providers include accessibility clauses.

## 3. Build Accessibility Into Business Operations

- Design & Development Teams
  - Implement inclusive design principles for websites, mobile apps, and software.
  - Train designers and developers on WCAG 2.1 standards and assistive technologies.
  - Adopt automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, WAVE, Lighthouse).

- Marketing & Content Teams
  - Ensure PDFs, videos, and marketing materials are accessible (e.g., alt text, captions, keyboard navigation).
  - Review e-commerce platforms for screen reader compatibility and clear navigation.

- Customer Service & Support
  - Provide accessible communication channels (e.g., chat, phone, and email options for customers with disabilities).
  - Train staff to assist customers who use assistive technologies.

- Procurement & Vendor Management
  - Require third-party suppliers to meet accessibility standards.
  - Integrate accessibility clauses into new contracts for digital products and services.

## 4. Monitor, Test, and Iterate

- Regular Accessibility Testing
 - Run quarterly accessibility audits using both automated tools and real-user testing (including people with disabilities).

- Stay Ahead of Regulation Changes
 - Monitor EU country-specific EAA enforcement policies as they evolve.

- Report Progress & Maintain Compliance
 - Prepare for potential compliance checks by regulators.
 - Document accessibility efforts to demonstrate good faith compliance in case of legal challenges.

## 5. Shift Mindset: Accessibility as a Business Opportunity

- Expand Market Reach
  - The EAA affects 135 million people with disabilities in the EU, representing a market worth up to €1 trillion in disposable income.

- Enhance Brand Reputation
  - Proactive compliance demonstrates corporate responsibility and strengthens brand loyalty.

- Future-Proof Digital Transformation
  - Accessibility is becoming a global standard (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S. and similar laws worldwide). Early adoption ensures long-term competitiveness.

# What Designers, Developers, Content Creators, and Product Designers Should Do to Prepare for the EAA

## 1. UX/UI Designers & Product Designers

- Adopt an Inclusive Design Approach
  - Apply accessible design principles from the start instead of retrofitting accessibility later.
  - Design with color contrast, scalable fonts, and keyboard navigation in mind.

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA Guidelines
  - Ensure text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
  - Use clear, structured heading levels (H1, H2, H3).
  - Avoid using color alone to convey meaning (e.g., error states).

- Design for Assistive Technologies
  - Ensure all UI components are keyboard navigable (no mouse required).
  - Design interfaces that work with screen readers and voice commands.

- Use Figma & Design System Accessibility Features
  - Implement accessible components in design systems (buttons, forms, modals, etc.).
  - Use Figma plugins like Stark, Able, or Contrast to check color and contrast.

## 2. Developers & Engineers

- Code for Accessibility (A11y) from the Start
  - Follow semantic HTML best practices.
  - Ensure all interactive elements have ARIA roles, labels, and descriptions.
  - Implement focus states for users navigating via keyboard.

- Use Automated Accessibility Testing
  - Run audits with Lighthouse, axe DevTools, and WAVE.
  - Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipelines.

- Ensure Dynamic Content Updates Are Accessible
  - Use ARIA live regions for screen reader users when content updates dynamically.
  - Prevent focus loss when modals or pop-ups close.

- Optimize for Performance & Responsiveness
  - Accessible products load faster and perform better for all users.
  - Ensure pages are mobile-friendly and work with zoom up to 200%.

## 3. Content Creators, Copywriters, & Marketers

- Write Accessible Copy & Content
  - Use clear, simple language and avoid jargon.
  - Ensure headings, lists, and links are properly structured and descriptive.

- Make PDFs, Videos, & Images Accessible
  - Add alt text for images (avoid “image123.jpg”).
  - Use closed captions and transcripts for video and audio content.
  - Ensure PDFs are tagged and screen-reader friendly (avoid scanned images of text).

- Use Inclusive Language & Representation
  - Avoid ableist language (e.g., use “click here” → “Read More”).
  - Represent diverse people and disabilities in imagery and campaigns.

## 4. Product Managers & Teams

- Prioritize Accessibility in Roadmaps
  - Assign accessibility tasks as core product features, not optional add-ons.
  - Establish an accessibility backlog for improvements.

- Train Teams on Accessibility Best Practices
  - Host workshops or training on WCAG, screen readers, and accessible UI patterns.
  - Encourage collaboration between design, dev, and content teams.

- Test with Real Users, Not Just Automation
  - Conduct usability testing with people with disabilities.
  - Get feedback on screen reader experience, keyboard navigation, and ease of use.
